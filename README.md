# VideoGame-in-2.5D
Platform Video game prototype in 2.5D and 3D build through Java.
This is a prototype of a Platform Video Game.
On these files I'm exploring different characters and possibilities.
Its a video Game in progress.
I'm playing with different characters but they could be change eventually.
The idea as a beginner video game programmer, is to play around with java while building and learning 
about video game implementation.
Special interest in Collision Detection.
Collision could be divided in parts:
Detecting a tile Collision
Correcting a sprite position to avoid a collision.
